# Connecting React with ChartJS

> npm i chart.js react-chartjs-2

In each graph component we need to call `import { Chart as ChartJS } from "chart.js/auto";` otherwise the graph won't render.

## Installation

> git clone https://github.com/ASproson/react-chartjs-spike.git

> npm i

> npm run start
